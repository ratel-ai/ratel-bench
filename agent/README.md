# `agent/`

End-to-end agent layer of the benchmark plus the unified suite orchestrator. Drives the Vercel AI SDK [`ToolLoopAgent`](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/tool-loop-agent) across two control arms and several non-control arms (see below), meters token usage, judges correctness, and emits one JSONL row per `(scenario, arm, model, run)` cell. Mode (c) per ADR-0006 is the agent campaign this layer powers.

Headline metrics in `REPORT.md` average per scenario across runs first, then across scenarios — so a scenario passing 4/5 runs contributes a 0.8 success rate, and high-run-count scenarios can't drown out the rest.

Pairs with the Rust retrieval-only layer at [`retrieval/`](../retrieval). For modes overview see [`../README.md`](../README.md). Locked decisions in [`docs/adr/0005-benchmark-design.md`](../docs/adr/0005-benchmark-design.md), [`0006`](../docs/adr/0006-benchmark-corpus-and-eval-modes.md), [`0007`](../docs/adr/0007-benchmark-corpus-not-snapshotted.md).

## Arms

Each arm is an `AgentDescriptor` (`{ id, label, run(input) }`) defined in its own file under [`src/agents/`](src/agents/). The runner builds a registry at startup and dispatches each cell to the arm's `run` function. Reading any one file shows the full integration end-to-end (tool construction, optional Ratel wiring, agent loop) — no implicit framework magic.

| id | label | path | what it does |
|---|---|---|---|
| `control-baseline` | control (baseline) | `agents/control-baseline.ts` | Every tool in the expanded pool, registered directly. Fat-context floor. |
| `control-oracle`   | control (oracle)   | `agents/control-oracle.ts`   | Only the gold tools. Upper bound on what the model can do given perfect selection. **Pool-size-agnostic**: emits one cell per (scenario, model, run) regardless of `--pool-sizes`; the row's `pool_size` is `null` and the report shows it as `—` with the real catalog count (~1–2) in the `catalog` column. |
| `ratel-full`       | ratel (full)       | `agents/non-control/ratel-full.ts` | BM25 top-K of the prompt pre-fetched as direct tools, **plus** the `search_tools` / `invoke_tool` gateway. The canonical Ratel surface. |
| `ratel-pre-discovery`  | ratel (pre-discovery only) | `agents/non-control/ratel-pre-discovery.ts` | BM25 top-K only — no gateway. Ablation: did pre-fetch alone suffice? |
| `ratel-discovery-tool` | ratel (discovery-tool only) | `agents/non-control/ratel-discovery-tool.ts` | Gateway only — no pre-fetch. Ablation: can the agent self-discover with a strong index? |
| `claude-sdk-tool-search` | claude-sdk (tool-search tool) | `agents/non-control/ignore.claude-sdk-tool-search.ts` | **Local-only, gitignored.** Anthropic's native [tool-search-tool](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/tool-search-tool) as a competitive baseline. Claude-only via `skipForModel`. |

The default `--arms` list excludes `claude-sdk-tool-search` (it lives behind a local-only gitignored file); opt in via `--arms ...,claude-sdk-tool-search` on a host that has wired it up.

`control-oracle` is committed in the default arm list, deviating from ADR-0006 ("oracle drops from the default arm list... stays available behind a flag"). Even under stubbed execution it's the cleanest selection-noise floor — the model's output coherence given exactly the gold tools and no distractors — and we want it in every report rather than gated behind a flag.

### Adding a local-only arm

Drop a new file in `src/agents/non-control/` whose name starts with `ignore.` (matches the local `.gitignore` rule). Export a `descriptor: AgentDescriptor` with a unique `id`. The runner's auto-discovery picks it up next time. Use this for prototypes, closed-SDK baselines, or any arm you don't want to commit yet.

```

## Run the whole benchmark

```bash
pnpm -F @ratel-ai/benchmark run-all
```

Ingests both corpora (if missing), runs retrieval modes (a) + (b), runs the mode-(c) agent campaign with conservative defaults if a provider key is set (skipped with a notice otherwise — keeping `run-all` $0 by default), and renders REPORT.md. See [`../README.md`](../README.md) for the full description.

Flags: `--force` (re-ingest), `--skip-ingest`, `--skip-agent` (skip mode (c) even with keys), `--only metatool|toolret`.

The auto-invoked mode (c) defaults to: 50 sampled scenarios × 1 run × every committed arm (the two control arms plus the three ratel ablations), available models only (`claude-sonnet-4-6` and/or `gpt-5.4-mini` depending on which key is set), pool size 180, $5 global cap. The local-only `claude-sdk-tool-search` arm is excluded by default. For the headline variance run see the next section.

## Run the headline agent campaign (mode c)

```bash
# Required env (one or both):
#   OPENAI_API_KEY     — for gpt-5.4-mini
#   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY  — for claude-sonnet-4-6 (also powers the LLM judge)
#
# The default --corpus path expects the ingested MetaTool snapshot at
# test-data/metatool.jsonl. Run `pnpm -F @ratel-ai/benchmark run-all`
# (or `cargo run -p ratel-benchmark-retrieval --release -- ingest metatool --download`)
# first.

pnpm -F @ratel-ai/benchmark start \
  --output agent/results/agent.jsonl \
  --scenarios 200 \
  --arms control-baseline,control-oracle,ratel-full,ratel-pre-discovery,ratel-discovery-tool \
  --models gpt-5.4-mini,claude-sonnet-4-6 \
  --runs 5 \
  --top-k 5 \
  --pool-sizes 30,100,180 \
  --max-steps 12 \
  --dollar-global 25 \
  --concurrency 10
```

Resumable — re-runs skip cells already in `agent.jsonl` unless `--force`. Pass `--ephemeral` instead to write each smoke into a fresh `agent/results/ephemeral/agent-<timestamp>.jsonl` file so the canonical `agent.jsonl` stays untouched. `--scenarios N` samples a deterministic seeded subset of the full ~21k MetaTool query set; the same `--seed` reproduces the same subset across runs.

`--concurrency N` (default 10) controls how many cells run in parallel. The benchmark is wall-clock-bound on provider latency, so 10 typically yields ~10× speedup against cloud APIs. Dial down to `1` for Ollama (single-process server) or tight provider tiers. Dollar caps are best-effort under concurrency: in-flight cells finish, no new ones start, so overshoot is bounded by `concurrency × per-cell-cost` (~$0.30 at the defaults).

`--timeout-ms N` (default 60000) sets the per-cell wall-clock timeout. Cloud models rarely need more, but local Ollama models (especially CPU-bound or large 70B+) can comfortably exceed a minute on a 12-step trace — bump to `300000` (5 min) or higher when you see `run timed out after 60000ms` errors in the trace.

`--pool-sizes` controls the per-scenario tool catalog (gold + distractors pulled from other scenarios). Accepts a comma-separated list (e.g. `--pool-sizes 30,100,180`) — each scenario is evaluated at every requested size, and the report breaks the headline / savings / failure tables down per pool. Pass a single value to skip the sweep. The legacy singular form `--pool-size 180` still works as an alias for one value but rejects commas. The default (180) sits at the MetaTool plugin universe ceiling; smaller values stress retrieval less, larger values are clamped at the universe size. Pool-size-agnostic arms (currently just `control-oracle`) ignore this flag and emit one cell per (scenario, model, run) regardless of how many sizes are listed.

## Pinned `@ratel-ai/sdk` version

The benchmark consumes `@ratel-ai/sdk` from the npm registry at a version pinned in `agent/package.json` (currently `0.1.5`). The resolved version is stamped on every JSONL row as `ratel_version` and rendered in the report header. To benchmark a new ratel release: bump the pinned version, `pnpm install`, re-run. The previous-version JSONL keeps its rows — they're keyed by version, so they neither collide with nor satisfy the new run.

Edits to the upstream SDK in [`ratel-ai/ratel`](https://github.com/ratel-ai/ratel) therefore **don't** flow into the benchmark unless and until they're published. This is deliberate: we want the campaign to measure the same artifact users install, not whatever's on the working tree.

## Cached control runs

`control-baseline` and `control-oracle` cells are cached across invocations — they don't depend on the ratel code path being iterated on, so re-running them per campaign is pure waste. The cache is keyed by `(ratel_version, scenario_id, arm, model, pool_size, run_index)` and backed by the canonical `agent/results/agent.jsonl`.

- **Non-ephemeral runs** (default `--output`): control rows already in `agent.jsonl` are skipped via the existing resume path. Same as before, but now version-aware.
- **Ephemeral runs** (`--ephemeral`): the canonical `agent.jsonl` is opened read-only at start. For each scheduled cell, if its key is in the cache, the cached row is copied verbatim into the ephemeral output and the live agent loop is skipped. Ratel arms (`ratel-full` / `ratel-pre-discovery` / `ratel-discovery-tool`) still run live every time — that's the point of an ephemeral iteration.
- **`--force`** disables the cache (and truncates the output file in non-ephemeral mode), so the campaign always re-pays.

A run-start stderr line summarizes the hit count: `cache: 47 control cells reused from <path> (ratel 0.1.5), 153 will run`.

The `--output` cell summary at the end now reports `<run> cells run, <cached> cached, <skipped> skipped`.

For a fast local smoke (~$0.20–$1):

```bash
pnpm -F @ratel-ai/benchmark start \
  --scenarios 50 --runs 1 \
  --arms control-baseline,control-oracle,ratel-full \
  --models claude-sonnet-4-6 \
  --pool-sizes 180 \
  --dollar-global 5 \
  --concurrency 10
```

## Local models (Ollama)

The `ollama:` model prefix routes through a local [Ollama](https://ollama.com) server's OpenAI-compatible endpoint — no API keys, $0 cost. Tool calling depends on the model's native function-calling support: Qwen / Llama families work well, Gemma is hit-or-miss.

```bash
# Make sure Ollama is running and the model is pulled (`ollama pull qwen3.5`).

pnpm -F @ratel-ai/benchmark start \
  --scenarios 50 --runs 1 \
  --arms control-baseline,ratel-full \
  --models ollama:qwen3.5,ollama:gemma4 \
  --pool-sizes 30,180 \
  --judge-model ollama:qwen3.5 \  # cost-free local judge
  --concurrency 1 \               # local Ollama is single-process
  --timeout-ms 300000             # 5 min — local models often need more than 60s
```

Flags:
- `--ollama-base-url URL` — override the default `http://localhost:11434/v1` (or set `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` in the env). Useful for remote Ollama instances.
- `--judge-model MODEL` — pick any model id (cloud or `ollama:*`) for the LLM judge. Defaults to `claude-sonnet-4-6` when `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set, otherwise the LLM judge is disabled and only the programmatic verdict is recorded.

`dollar_cost` is recorded as `0` for `ollama:*` cells — `--dollar-global` therefore never trips on local-only runs. If you mix cloud + local models in one run, the cap still bounds the cloud spend. The model id keeps its `ollama:` prefix in the JSONL row and the report so local vs cloud cells stay distinguishable.

## Generate the report only

```bash
pnpm -F @ratel-ai/benchmark report \
  --agent agent/results/agent.jsonl \
  --retrieval results/retrieval.jsonl \
  --output results/REPORT.md
```

Auto-discovers every `*retrieval.jsonl` under `results/` if `--retrieval` is omitted.

## Tests

```bash
pnpm -F @ratel-ai/benchmark test
```

Unit tests cover the corpus reader, shared agent helpers (sanitization, schema normalization, tool-bundle assembly), per-arm bundle-builders (one test file per agent), agent registry auto-discovery, metering math (incl. `ratel_version` stamping), both judges (programmatic intersection + LLM prompt-only fallback), pool universe + distractor expansion, runner orchestration (resume / dollar caps / cell iteration / seeded sampling / pool-size-agnostic arms / control-row caching across ephemeral runs), and report aggregations (incl. null-`pool_size` handling and the `Catalog` column). Real LLM calls are not exercised in unit tests.
